              It is a strange time to choose to become a Jew. As I wrote the
              first of these words, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
              partially raised in an American synagogue not ten miles from where
              I live, had risen to the defense of the richest man in the world
              for raising a seig heil at the US presidential inauguration of a
              proud white supremacist; a white supremacist who has promised to
              enthusiastically accelerate settler colonialism and the genocide
              of Palestinians in Palestine; as the international political
              establishment works to broadly criminalize all anti-fascist
              dissent in the name of Jewish safety, including explicitly
              targeting Jewish organizations; at the behest of an unholy
              alliance of Christian/secular-Christian white supremacists and a
              good chunk of mainstream American Jewish organizations. That
              torrent of contradictions ceased to be a sentence several clauses
              ago; it is a bewildering, humiliating, and heartbreaking time to
              be a Jew. There is, perhaps, no other sort of time to be born or
              become a Jew; converts simply have the misfortune of having to
              articulate that explicitly.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is an essay by the academic Leah Tigers
              <span
                ><a href="#foot-leah-tigers" class="link-footnote">^</a>
                <span class="link-anchor" id="leah-tigers"
              /></span>
              which I think of frequently. Tigers' subject is, among other
              things, Magnus Hirschfeld's hired help, trans women whose
              employment at his Institute in Weimar Berlin was both personally
              necessary (nobody else would hire them) and billed as a public
              testament to the Institute's successes in innovative 'treatment'
              (nothing says feminine realness like a propensity for menial
              housework, of course). The essay is fascinating for all the usual
              reasons regarding Weimar, psychonalaysis, Jews, and
              transsexualism, but it's a throwaway line that I most often think
              of. Two of the girls, Toni and Charlotte, were a romantic couple,
              and Toni was, in 1930s Weimar Berlin as a broke disabled
              transsexual communist and woman, studying for conversion to
              (Charlotte's) Judaism. A stupider and more admirable decision is
              hard to imagine; though of course the biblical model, Ruth's
              conversion while risking starvation, sets the bar.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm not risking starvation, at least not knowingly; perhaps like
              Toni, my transsexualism and politics currently pose at least as
              much of a threat to my material wellbeing as my nascent Judaism
              does. But I too am joining the Jewish people(s) in a time of
              intense crisis. Nearly a century has passed since Toni lived
              during European nationalism's destruction of European Jewry. Today
              it is European nationalism's bastard children, Israeli and
              American nationalisms, which pose the immediate existential
              threat. It is far from clear that Judaism will emerge from
              political Zionism, the greatest heresy it has known, as anything
              but a parody (second time as farce) and extension of the European
              Protestant nationalisms it emulates.
            </p>
            <p>
              Watching the destruction of Palestine and Palestinian life,
              watching the eagerness of much of organized Jewish life to
              uphold-ignore this massacre, watching the shameless usurption of
              Jewish traditions in the name of blatantly assimilationist secular
              warmongering: the past few years have been an education in
              heartbreaking contradictions as well as and through ritual life.
              If I begin with portents of doom, it is because it would be
              impossible to tell a story of my coming to Judaism without them. I
              have not known a Judaism which was not staring at a precipice from
              which there is no certain return. I would hazard a guess that very
              few Jews throughout time have.
            </p>
            <p>
              When presented with the overwhelming vulnerability of the precious
              things in this world to violence and ruin, it is tempting to
              abandon the fight, or worse, to claim these gifts of Gd were never
              all that precious in the first place. It is this abandonment of
              the preciousness of vulnerability, its recasting as a pitiable
              weakness to be overcome, which is at the center of all blustering,
              genocidal nationalisms. It takes great strength and dedication to
              instead face the vulnerability of this world to evil and
              brokenness and commit to fighting for it anyways. Jewish study has
              taught me what it means to love something you know may be beyond
              your ability to save, and to commit to fighting for it anyway.
              Observing Judaism has provided me with the basis in my own life to
              commit to the impossible fights in front of me, as the stakes get
              higher and the outcomes bleaker.

              Writing an essay about how wonderful and precious it is to be a
              Jew in this moment feels like a joke of a task. With that joke
              acknowledged, I'm going to spend the rest of this essay doing just
              that. It is an urgent task to enumerate the beauty and goodness of
              this world, just as it is to acknowledge its brokenness; so many
              of us are far more practiced in the latter. I write the following
              words under the tiniest crescent moon of Adar 5785, dancing with
              the humor and horror of this month's coming in this year.

              Or in a less-literal translation, how lucky we are to be Jews
              doing Judaism. In my own idiom, observance is a practice of
              repeatedly refusing to turn away from the preciousness and
              vulnerability of life. Every morning we thank our Creator for
              returning our soul from its wanderings; we thank Gd for keeping
              our body functioning and acknowledge how fragile our inner
              workings are; we thank Gd for creating sustenance, for housing us,
              for freeing us, for clothing us, for giving us Torah and study,
              for all the ritual actions which link us to our tradition day
              after day. We remember our sick and our dead, cherishing their
              memories and speaking their names at every gathering. We carve one
              day out of every week to experience a fleeting taste of the world
              as it is meant to be, filled with community and song and freed of
              this current world's domination. We remind ourselves with yearning
              melodies that this respite is what we are fighting to establish
              every day of the week, soon and in our days. We pray our desires
              for wholeness in this world thrice per day, acknowledging our
              frailties and failures, rendering praise for all the beauty in
              this world, and fervently petitioning for the coming of its
              complete healing. Becoming conversant in Jewish ritual is a
              humbling exercise in learning, on the one hand, to yearn for the
              impossible and fantastic; and on the other, to offer real
              gratitude for the basic and so often insufficient conditions of
              life in a broken world.
            </p>
            <p>
              I have worked over the past six months or so to build a daily
              prayer practice for myself. It has been empowering and humbling to
              stumble through unfamiliar words and melodies in an ancient
              tongue, slowly picking up rhythym and speed and familiarity. I
              have come to love the section of the traditional rite which ends
              with the lines quoted above. It does not seem to have a standard
              name, but begins with "l'olam y'hei adam" and is quoted directly
              from a midrashic text, Tanna De-Vei Eliyahu 21.
              <span
                ><a href="#foot-tanna" class="link-footnote">^</a>
                <span class="link-anchor" id="tanna"
              /></span>
              The section begins with a distractingly beautiful litany of human
              insufficiencies and ultimate meaninglessness before Gd's great
              eternalness, literally ending with "and the dominion of humankind
              over the beast is nothing, for everything is hot air."<span
                ><a href="#foot-air" class="link-footnote">^</a>
                <span class="link-anchor" id="air" /></span
              >The middle section contrasts human ephemeralness with the eternal
              covenant between Gd and Gd's people using a sort of 'Best of the
              Patriarchs' highlights reel; finally, we get the section above,
              transitioning to a "teaser" Shema before the full blessings of the
              Shema following Psukei.
            </p>
            <p>
              These lines, for me, offer a succinct and resonant theology of
              Judaism. Our human works are nothing before the Eternal One, for
              all will perish in the blink of an eye; yet the miracle of the
              survival of the Jewish covenant with Gd expresses deep and abiding
              love; so therefore you should say the Shema twice a day and be
              happy about it. Amein v'amein!
            </p>
            <p>
              Humor aside, it is this dance between the fleeting, daring breath
              of the davener and the ancientness of the act of davening which
              makes Jewish prayer so sacred. To pray a service is to participate
              in the longest-running rabbinic Jewish art project in existence.
              If Jews create our temples in time, as R' Heschel suggests,<span
                ><a href="#foot-heschel" class="link-footnote">^</a>
                <span class="link-anchor" id="heschel"
              /></span>
              Jewish prayer is the Hagia Sophia<span
                ><a href="#foot-hagia" class="link-footnote">^</a>
                <span class="link-anchor" id="hagia"
              /></span>
              of Jewish architecture. We (world Jewry) are constantly adding and
              altering and reinterpreting these words, dressing them in our
              local melodies, coloring them to suit our needs and speak to our
              moment. Every morning as I recite my rote words of gratitude, I am
              struck by the immense gift it is to recieve these words, struggle
              with them, and pass them around, as so many dozens of generations
              before me have. When there is conflict in local Jewish communal
              life and when the news brings fresh pain, it is so good to be
              forced to acknowledge: This tradition is a precious gift, and we
              are so lucky to be stewarding it.
            </p>
            <h3>l'dor v'dor</h3>
            <p>
              Engaging with ancient words is an exercise in humility, in setting
              aside one's own world and concerns to try to understand the world
              and concerns of the generations of Jews who have worked and
              reworked these words. The secular-protestant-capitalist world we
              inhabit does not encourage exercises in humility; surviving,
              particularly for the downtrodden, often means enduring extensive
              exercises in humiliation while practicing defensive exercises in
              vindictive pride. Studying ancient words and the extensive
              attempts to understand them through the centuries offers a rare
              chance to strengthen the muscles of "I don't know" and "I don't
              understand."
            </p>
            <p>
              For me, this is the gift of all observance (of which
              non-observance is a part): the ability to participate in the
              conversation and practice of wrestling with the meanings of the
              things we say and the things we do throughout time. In Walter
              Benjamin's words, it is an attempt to "deliver tradition anew from
              the conformism which is on the point of overwhelming it;" or to
              borrow Donna Haraway's line, non/observance is "faithful as
              blasphemy is faithful."<span
                ><a href="#foot-donna" class="link-footnote">^</a>
                <span class="link-anchor" id="donna"
              /></span>
              Even when one limits oneself to speaking about to Rabbinic Jews in
              the post-Rabbinized era, Jewish communal life has constantly
              transformed and been transformed wildly by the cultures and times
              it has lived in. To borrow a metaphor from the Rabbis which they
              would almost certainly find discomfiting, we have absorbed
              infinite 'tastes'<span
                ><a href="#foot-taam" class="link-footnote">^</a>
                <span class="link-anchor" id="taam"
              /></span>
              from the worlds we have lived in, metaphysically flavoring our
              understandings of our traditions even when the actions and words
              stay the same. It is impossible to do Judaism in the same way as
              our ancestors and have it mean the same thing to us, the world, or
              their memories; if it <i>were</i> possible, it certainly would not
              make for a Judaism worth handing down generation to generation.
              The mitzvah, in the Passover seder as in life, is to experience it
              as if <i>you</i> and your generation were the ones coming out of
              Egypt.<span
                ><a href="#foot-egypt" class="link-footnote">^</a>
                <span class="link-anchor" id="egypt"
              /></span>
              It is the struggle between the ephemeral and the eternal, and the
              insistence on their twining, which weaves vitality into the
              spirals of Jewish time.<span

            <h3>observance</h3>
            <p>
              Before I continue, a quick note on the word 'observance.' I've
              been using it here in a highly idiosyncratic way to refer to:
            </p>

              As far as I consider myself to be bound to a covenant, I consider
              myself obligated to learn about what Jews have been doing
              throughout time and why, and participate in the communal task of
              handing a meaningful, liberateratory, and just Judaism down to
              those Jews who come after me.

              I've taken on daily observances slowly. It is important to me for
              my observance to retain the feeling of respite and understanding
              of permanent commitment which accompanied my beginning to observe
              Shabbat. I relish the "na'aseh and nishma" of familiarizing myself
              with a new observance: the sense of <i>oh, so</i> that's
              <i>the reason we do this</i> carries all the satisfaction of
              puzzle pieces locking into place. In a Jewish communal context
              where observance communicates a lot about who one is and how one
              wants to be seen as a Jew, it has felt empowering to decide for
              myself when and how to add observances, rather than adhering to
              any particular movement's halacha or community's norms.

              I have two good Jewish friends for whom, in their own individual
              ways, the surrender and lack of choice in traditional halacha is
              deeply meaningful. With love and respect for this relationship to
              Jewish law, it is just not an approach which works for me. I have
              too many questions about who made up the rules, when, why, who's
              been actually following them and how and when, whether we'd even
              like it if everyone actually did follow them, etc etc to find a
              'surrender' in adhering to any particular movement's rulings. I
              struggle too with the knowledge that so much of the power of
              Jewish observance is communal. It is a privilege gifted through
              struggle, luck, and often straight up access to wealth to live
              free within a community of Jews wanting to cocreate a compatible
              Judaism together. Contradictorily, this knowledge has made me
              <i>more</i> idiosyncratic in my observance. While it is a blessing
              to influence and be influenced by the minhagim and knowledge of
              those in my community, and while Judaism is not a practice one can
              do alone, it is important to me that I cultivate a core
              relationship to Gd which is not reliant on access to a nearby
              community of Jews who will let an antizionist communist
              transsexual convert in the door. We do not live in times which
              allow the luxury of imagining this sort of community to be an
              eternal given. Being intentional about the shape of my observance
              and its meaning is one way I strive to cultivate this individual
              relationship even as it is beautifully informed and affected by
              the amazing Jews I am in blessed to be in community with.

              If it is painful to articulate love for fragile things, how much
              more so to narrate the process of coming to love them. I've saved
              the 'disclosure narrative' section for last. It is often
              embarrassing to show parts of our selves while they are under
              construction, so to speak. Transgender people, particularly women,
              know this well. People (well. some people) love to shower praise
              and attention on trans people who are confident, self-assured,
              passing, and pretty. People are generally much colder to those in
              the terrified, clocky, insecure, and desperate stage of the
              process. While very much <i>not</i> limited to converts, there is
              a clear Jewish analog to this phenomenon. (Nobody likes to see how
              the turkey bacon gets made? I'll show myself out. . . )

              You would think it would have gotten easier for me to talk about
              the process of becoming Jewish over the past three years, but that
              has not been the case. The first problem is that there really
              isn't a right way to have done the thing; you're supposed to have
              been born & raised that way. Our communal myths around conversion
              involve a lot of groveling and the expectation of being turned
              away or ignored; while from my vantage point it seems like
              conversion over the ages has been somewhat of an open secret, you
              would not know it from what (little) knowledge circulates around
              conversion in many Jewish spaces. Supposedly there's a cheat code
              for those with Jewish heritage who were not raised Jewish, but
              after being close to several such Jews who are reconnecting, it
              seems more like an 'extra baggage and hangups' code than a fast
              track. The second problem is that there is simply no way to
              express finding Jewishness as an adult without sounding at least a
              little bit like a born-again Christian. Not the image potential
              Jews want to be projecting!

              It is important to me to include in this essay an accounting of
              how I came to Judaism and some of the 'tastes' I am bringing with
              me into the diverse Jewish peoples I am joining. If it is awkward
              at times and (Gd forbid) born-againey at others, I hope my readers
              will forgive me. There is a halachic concept that converts emerge
              from the mikveh as newborns, exiting as whole new Jews from the
              "womb" of the mikveh.<span

              If the born-again metaphor of Christian baptism emerged from the
              same immersion-loving Abrahamic soup as the metaphors of Rabbinic
              Judaism, I ask my readers to kindly allow me some messiness
              (....soupiness, if you will) of my own.

              There is often a hint of incredulity when a born Jew finds out
              about my conversion status. <i>Now?</i> You still want in, after
              all of this? Don't you know that the Jews are anguished,
              suppressed, despised, and harassed? And what's more, that we, too,
              have been doing our share of suppressing and despising and
              harrassing? It's hard to find a tactful answer to these questions
              when they are voiced; harder still when they go unspoken. The easy
              way out of this conversation is the ontological argument, removing
              choice from the picture--- if gays were "born this way," converts
              were "present at Sinai," possessing of a latent Jewishness which
              conversion merely formalizes. Both these origin stories edge close
              to a theology of predestination in order to elide the agency of
              the (undesireable) subject which, against all odds, desires the
              "undesireable." Loathe as I am to give up a narrative in which Gd
              personally cuts in and drops me off at Sinai for the brit, there
              is an alternative explanation: at a certain point in my life, I
              saw a life ahead of me that was worth living, and it involved
              becoming Jewish.

            <h3>roots</h3>
            <p>
              I grew up in small-town/semi-rural Oregon; there are historically
              not a ton of Jews in even the urban areas of Oregon, and if there
              were any in my hometown they were certainly not loud about it.
              Prior to conversion, my knowledge of Judaism began and ended at
              what I had been exposed to in college at Haverford, in the Philly
              suburbs, where it seemed from my extremely limited vantage point
              that American Jews were mostly secular antizionists, and that
              Judaism mostly consisted of being into the history of
              psychoanalysis, holding the occasional Passover seder, and maybe
              lighting a Yartzeit candle. Correcting this picture and finding my
              way to Judaism could be seen as a byproduct of a much
              longer-running interest of mine: finding somewhere to sing.

              I was raised what you might call 'secular' or 'culturally'
              Mennonite. While fully explaining my relationship to my Anabaptist
              heritage would take an entire other essay, I'll speedrun the
              highlights here. I was raised with my father's side of the family
              in small-town Oregon. My father's side is Mennonite going back to
              the Reformation, and proudly and devoutly musical, as many large
              Mennonite families are. My mother, raised in a
              Catholic-turned-Evangelical family, went to a Mennonite college,
              where she met and married my father in (with hindsight) a ~30 year
              long detour into Mennonite heterosexuality on her path to secular
              lesbianism.

              /></span>
              My childhood and adolescence was marked by a show of wills with
              regard to religion. My mother, increasingly disenchanted with the
              casual misogyny and colonial doctrine she saw in the Christian
              theology in her circles, was groping her way out of Christianity
              altogether. My father, whose commitment to the Mennonite faith
              continues to be mostly music- and food-based and therefore not up
              to the task of defending theology, would fight bitterly against
              attending any non-Mennonite service (the music! it's so awful!),
              and then proceed to invariably sleep through the sermons which so
              offended my mother. It is perhaps not a surprise that I came out
              of all this with a deeply seated and discerning love for vocal
              music, and very little else of spiritual value.

              It is hard to overemphasize the importance of singing in my
              family. For years, whenever I have called my grandfather, his
              first question about my life has been "are you still singing?
              Where are you singing?" In undergrad I could answer this by
              talking about what I was singing in my college choir, often pieces
              my grandfather was familiar with and that other family members had
              sang. Within a year of graduating from school, the pandemic hit,
              and my grandfather's questions turned to wondering when
              <i>he</i> would be able to sing again with the family. It took
              until the winter of 2022, after two years of interacting with
              almost nobody but my roommates and closest friends, to realize how
              impoverished my life had become and how desperate I was for so
              many things. For good singing, obviously, but also for being in a
              physical space with young people and old people, something my
              freelance work at the time did not provide me. After having many
              conversations with my partner about the fact that places of
              worship are some of the only places to go for intergenerational
              community outside of birth family in the US, I decided to check
              out the two gay-inclusive Mennonite congregations in Philadelphia.

            <h3>somewhere to sing</h3>
            <p>
              What resulted were two scenes that I can only narrate as bas-kol
              'voice from the heavens' moments. While explicating these scenes
              would require a primer on Mennonite cultural tropes and my own
              strong liturgical preferences, suffice it to say that these two
              services were slapstick-comedy levels of 'not what I was looking
              for.' I left with an overwhelming bodily sense that there was
              nothing here for me; that while the values and cultural traditions
              which had been passed down through my father's side were
              invaluable parts of who I am and what I want to pass forward, the
              Mennonite church as it exists now was not the place I wanted to be
              making a home, and Mennonite/Christian theology not an idiom I was
              interested in adopting. It would have been heartbreaking --- if it
              wasn't so funny! It was certainly bittersweet to realize this
              tradition was not something I'd be coming home to eventually, as
              I'd assumed somewhere in the back of my mind for many years. But
              the scale of the disconnect between my needs and values and the
              priorities and values of Mennonite communal spaces was just
              achingly and unsurmountably wide, and had been for some time. It
              was a relief in many ways to get such a clear sign.
            </p>
            <p>
              In between these two momentously-inadequate services, I had
              decided to get over myself and try out a service at a local
              synagogue. My partner, raised devoutly-secular but Jewish, had
              been shyly expressing a desire to try out going to synagogue for
              several years; I decided if he wasn't ready to take that step, I
              wanted to go and see if there was anything that felt more true for
              me.

              In a mirror image of the Mennonite services I had attended, the
              first Shabbat service I attended felt terrifyingly resonant. I
              realized with a characteristic immediacy and intensity that
              <i>this</i>
              was where I wanted to be, even though I had no right in the world
              to want it. The months and years that have followed that moment
              have been full of both overwhelming doubt and surprising
              revelations about that initial feeling of rightness. I am grateful
              to myself for cultivating the practice of listening to still small
              voices --- or in my case, blunt-force-to-the-back-of-the-head
              voices --- when they come, even and especially when it takes years
              of transition to fully realize their truths.

            <h3>beginnings</h3>
            <p>
              I started converting in earnest around the time of the leak of the
              SCOTUS abortion decision in spring of 5782/2022. I vividly
              remember how I was feeling at the time. Everything felt so fragile
              and temporary and vulnerable. It felt like there was no way I'd
              have time to actually convert before political violence got to me.
              I had the insistent feeling I'd die before I learned the things I
              needed to learn and built the practices I wanted to build. In many
              ways I still feel this way; there are so many things I want to
              learn, and the future feels murkier and more swiftly approaching
              by the day. Then as now, this urgent hunger for knowledge is
              certainly fueled by the uncertainty of the times, but also by the
              solidity and resolve I get from the Judaism I am currently doing.
              There is an internal-communal solidity I want to actively
              cultivate in my life to meet the challenges coming for all of us
              on this planet. Observing Judaism is the idiom which has felt most
              powerful and true for me to express and cultivate that solidity
              for myself and my community.
            </p>
            <p>
              I started with Shabbat. It felt like a natural place to start; I
              was craving a break from the relentless news cycles and constant
              feeling of overwhelm from the pandemic. I began by simply turning
              my phone off between candles and Havdalah, and was shocked by how
              powerful and necessary that change felt. Shabbat still feels like
              a time apart, when fears of the world retreat slightly if only
              because the bad news can't get to me --- I quite literally won't
              pick up the phone. I knew it would take discipline to decide, week
              after week, to set aside the horrors and the urgency and the numb
              of screen time aside for a small taste of another world. What I
              <i>didn't</i> expect was for this discipline to come with ease,
              and immediately feel like such a weight lifted. Those first few
              months felt like a literal breath of fresh air, like there was
              some essential nutrient I'd been starving myself of and which
              wandering around Philadelphia without the immediate ability to
              check my phone notifications was somehow providing. There are
              times when being (idiosyncratically) Shabbat-observant feels like
              one giant logistical headache; only a couple of even my Jewish
              friends are no-phones-shomer and so figuring out how to coordinate
              seeing loved ones on the weekends often takes a lot of double
              texting and frustration on all sides. But I've never seriously
              considered dropping this from my Shabbat practice; each week, I
              can feel something within me release when I light the candles and
              lock the work of the week out for 25 hours.

              I made my way through that first year reading Arthur Waskow's
              excellent <i>Seasons of Our Joy</i> and googling the greetings,
              quietly showing up to holidays and hoping nobody could tell how
              petrified I was and how little I knew. (They could, and they were
              all very nice about it.) In retrospect, it feels like a painful
              sort of blessing to have been able to make my way through the full
              Jewish calendar before Israel's (latest) brutal assault on Gaza
              began. Each holiday now comes with an education on how far the
              fascist right can go in appropriating sacred texts and traditions
              for its deathmaking, how much of a joke the state of Israel has
              made of any remaining myth of Jewish exceptionalism.

            <p>
              If this essay has been at times deeply ambivalent, I hope you (my
              rabbis) will forgive me. I have fallen deeply in love with Judaism
              and Jews; I am coming to the court, as it were, with no
              reservations about my decision to join the Jewish people and eager
              to have that choice formalized and ritually confirmed. One of the
              greatest gifts of rabbinic Jewish liturgy and ritual is its
              constant wedding of grief and joy. It is deeply bittersweet to be
              joining the Jewish people in this historical moment. So much pain
              and heartbreak and has broken through the surface of communal
              life, both within Jewish communities and on the global political
              stage. Yet it is also a painful sort of gift to be joining in this
              moment of rupture, where old narratives and answers can no longer
              be taken for granted, and when so many on the margins of Jewish
              life are pushing their way into the center of shaping the
              traditions we will, Gd willing, pass onward. May we all, be''H, be
              nourished in building diverse exillic Judaisms to meet this
              rupture with bravery and commitment to one another and to the
              world we steward.

            <p>
              It takes a shtetl to make a Jew, as the saying goes, so some
              gratitude is in order.
            </p>
            <p>
              First of all, to Gd, to the Holy One blessed be, to all that is
              wonderful and miraculous and bizarre and beautiful in this world:
              praise and gratitude for regularly giving me both the kicks in the
              ass I need and the resolve for doing the followup work.
            </p>
            <p>
              To my rabbis:
              <span
                ><a href="#foot-name" class="link-footnote">^</a>
                <span class="link-anchor" id="name"
              /></span>
              I am so, so grateful to have met such an amazing team of rabbis
              willing and capable of crafting a meaningful conversion process
              for the person I am and the world we are living in. Confirming
              this decision means the world to me. You have my eternal gratitude
              & I have made donations in each of your honor to a fund supporting
              Palestinian communities in Masafer Yatta in holding on to their
              lands and liveways. It has been a gift to learn from your deep
              knowledge these past months. I hope to cross paths many more times
              as we struggle for a freer and more just world in the years to
              come.

              To Em, who certainly did not realize what can of worms they opened
              by mentioning to me that they sometimes attended shul to see
              children and elders several years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
              To August and Des, my good friends of so many years, who have
              patiently put up with me prattling on about things they do not
              know about and do not care about for many years now. Begging their
              forgiveness in advance - I promise to continue this behavior for
              many years to come.
            </p>
            <p>
              To my father, for installing in me a deep appreciation for good
              music and the skills to cultivate it in my life. Whenever I
              effortlessly find the fifth to harmonize with a new melody at
              shul, I come to a new appreciation for his habit of drilling
              intervals with me on all our road trips growing up. I am proud to
              be part of passing along strong traditions of sacred music, and so
              grateful to have found a path in life which offers me the ability
              to continue to sing beautiful songs in community. (If I ever do
              have children, I promise to teach them 606 to the best of my
              abilities.)
            </p>
            <p>
              To my mother, for installing in me an uncompromising attention to
              treating people well, philosophically and personally. She taught
              me the importance of moral clarity through her rigorously loving
              desire to interrogate why people do the absolutely batshit things
              they often do. I am so grateful to have learned from her refusal
              to resign herself to injustice in community and theology alike.
              Her doggedness in pursuing human dignity and truth over so many
              decades, often while those around her happily buried their heads
              in the sand, has served as a model for me. I hope to find this
              resolve and courage somewhere in myself when moments of reckoning
              are due, as they so often are.
            </p>
            <p>
              To char and Akiva, dear chevrutot and friends, whose brilliance
              has sharpened my own in so many ways. May we study and argue
              together in love for many years to come.
            </p>
            <p>
              To all the Jews who are building rigorous and welcoming Jewish
              community in Philadelphia and the world. Your love for Judaism is
              such a blessing to all who are struggling to find their spot
              within this tradition. May we live to see a Judaism beyond Zionism
              and a world without nations, soon and in our days.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, to my partner Miles, without whose presence in my life
              <i>so</i> much would have taken <i>so</i> long to figure out.
              Thank you for allowing me to rudely beat you to the punch on the
              getting religiously Jewish front; it's fair play for your beating
              me to transsexualism. I am so proud to be building our home
              together Jewishly. You have shaped me and my Judaism in so many
              beautiful ways, and I am so proud of us for creating a respite and
              a reality for ourselves to inhabit together. Thank you for
              treating me gently during this often-terrifying and unsettling
              process, for making me so many meals, for pushing me to become the
              person I want to be in this world.

                I am, of course, aware that this interpretation of Jewish
                history and the instruction regarding Passover is a
                <i>deeply</i> modern/post-Haskalah way to look at things.

                broke my brain when I first read it. The concept that Jews
                actually have <i>not</i> always been known for their love of
                history (and quite the reverse) explains a lot about the
                disconnect between the ways Jewish history is uptaken in
                different Jewish contexts.

                I would like to officially recommend a novel strategy for kiruv:
                reaching out to non-Jews who are dating non-Jewishly-involved
                Jews, and asking if them if they're at all latently Jewish
                themselves. Among the handful of Jewish converts I have met,
                many of us took the first baby step of expressing interest in
                Jewishness by dating a Jew; and an excellent cure for the
                feeling of "I'm-not-Jewish-enough" is to have someone around who
                is undeniably less Jewish and therefore allowed to look stupid
                and ask questions.
